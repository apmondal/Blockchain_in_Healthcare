# Blockchain in Healthcare

We are build a decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain.

Frameworks, tools and extensions -
1. <strong>Truffle framework</strong> - It allows us to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. 
                                      It provides a suite of tools that allow us to write smart contacts with the Solidity programming language. 
                                      It also enables us to test our smart contracts and deploy them to the blockchain. It also gives us a place to 
                                      develop our client-side application.
2. <strong>Ganache</strong> - It is a local in-memory blockchain, it will give us 10 external accounts with addresses on our local Ethereum blockchain. 
                                Each account is preloaded with 100 fake ether.
3. <strong>Metamask</strong> - It is an extension for Google Chrome. In order to use the blockchain, we must connect to it, using metamask weâ€™ll be able to 
                                connect to our local Ethereum blockchain with our personal account, and interact with our smart contract.
